Made an android application in Java that simulates the functionalities of google maps with various extra functionalities.

A school group project made in unit/period 2.2 between 9 Nov - 29 Jan, 2021.

This app and project was used to mock the intertaction between client and programming team. 
The mockup and requirements were made by another group within our class. 
We then built/made the application based on their vision and feedback.
